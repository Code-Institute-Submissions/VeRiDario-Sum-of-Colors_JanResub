# Sum-of-Colors

First project for Code Institute Diploma in Full Stack Software Development

##Technologies Used

In this project we used some simple HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript to build the project'.

## ***Introduction***

Sum of colors is a game to guess how the colors mix themselves. It has 2 difficulty levels: Hard and Easy.

### Features

1.	The Navigation links in the center the page. Users can click on the Hard and Easy button. Each button links to the correspondent section of the website.
2.	The Navigation buttons Font and code change the size of the characters once you point the mouse on them. This is very user-friendly because the user knows exactly where the mouse is pointing and clicking, especially for people having troubles in reading.
3.	The Navigation is clear and user friendly by leading you to the section you are interested in.

# Sum of Colors

First project for Code Institute Diploma in Full Stack Software Development

[View the "Sum of Colors" website here on GitHub Pages.](https://veridario.github.io/Sum-of-Colors/)

## Technologies Used

In this project we used some simple HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript to build the project'.

## ***Introduction***

Sum of colors is a game to guess how the colors mix themselves. It has 2 difficulty levels Hard and Easy. People just have to guess the color resulting from the mix. If the player guesses right, the pop up will indicate “Right Answer”. If the player guesses wrong, the pop up will notify “Wrong Answer”. The score area will automatically count the number of correct and wrong answers. 

### Features

1.           The Navigation links in the center the page. Users can click on the Hard and Easy button to choose the difficulty level they want to play. Each button links to the correspondent section of the website and to the corresponding difficulty level.

2.           The Navigation buttons Font and code change the size of the characters once you point the mouse on them. This is very user-friendly because the user knows exactly where the mouse is when pointing and clicking, especially for people having troubles in reading.

3.           The Navigation is clear and user friendly. It has the ability to bring you to the section you are interested in.

## ***Testing***

* The game has been tested on Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge and it properly works.
* I made sure that the game was responsive.
*  I made sure that the form worked: when entering the right and wrong answer the pop up notification shows up and the colors change to give people the chance to play more.
*The score area correctly updates the number of wrong and right answers

### Lighthouse Testing

* Accesibility
  -I confirmed that the colors and fonts chosen are easy to read and accesible by running it through lighthouse in devtools.

### Fixed Bugs

* The game did not uploaded the new color mix options after the wrong or right answer. I added a function able to reload the color mix option.


##Deployment

*	The site was created in Gitpod, deployed to Github directly from the Terminal.
